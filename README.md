## Basic Details
### Team Name: VOID

### Project Description
GossipHub is an anonymous message board where anyone can drop a gossip, hot take, or secret, and nobody will know who posted it. No usernames, no phone numbers, no IP logs. Even the admin can‚Äôt trace your identity. Just pure, unfiltered gossip!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Gossiping in the real world is a logistical nightmare. It's often slow, requires physical presence, and the risk of being caught is far too high. This stifles the natural human desire for sharing ridiculous, unfiltered information.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By creating a platform for broadcasting private chats, GossipHub removes all the friction from gossiping. Our platform ensures total anonymity, allowing users to share their most outrageous thoughts without a second thought. It's an information superhighway for useless chatter.
